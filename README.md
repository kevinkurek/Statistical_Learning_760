# Statistical_Learning_760

### Repo was created for projects/homework coming from Statistical Learning 760 at the University of Nevada, Reno.
### Professor: Raúl Rojas González.
- Class is designed to teach the statistical theory and linear algebra underlying common machine learning methodologies.
- Homework is to code up the models we learned in class. I chose Python.
- Books used for class: 
  1) Elements of Statistical Learning: Jerome H. Friedman, Robert Tibshirani, and Trevor Hastie.
  2) Neural Networks - A Systematic Introduction: Raúl Rojas González (yes, the same professor teaching the class).

Items this repo contains:
  1) HW1, k-Nearest Neighbors for Subset Digit Recognition.
  2) HW2 Part 1, Linear Regression for Subset Digit Recognition.
  3) HW2 Part 2, k-subset feature selection with looped Linear Regression for Prostate Cancer Data.
  4) HW3, Principal Component Analysis for Dimension Reduction into Gaussian Modeling for Digits.
