# Statistical_Learning_760

### Repo was created for projects/homework coming from Statistical Learning 760 at the University of Nevada, Reno.
### Class is designed to teach the statistical theory and linear algebra underlying common machine learning methodologies.
### Homework is to code up the models we learned in class. I choose Python.

Items this repo contains:
  1) HW1, k-Nearest Neighbors for Subset Digit Recognition.
  2) HW2 Part 1, Linear Regression for Subset Digit Recognition.
  3) HW2 Part 2, k-subset feature selection with looped Linear Regression for Prostate Cancer Data.
